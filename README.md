# üî• REDFIST ‚Äî Modern Project Landing (Safe Demo)

**REDFIST** is presented here as a *documentation and demo storefront* that showcases
features and design for a security-tool project **for educational and authorized-use only**.
This distribution intentionally **does not** include any operational exploit, payload,
C2, or scanning code. All modules are placeholders and documentation-only to prevent misuse.

---
## What you'll find in this package
- `index.html` ‚Äî Modern, responsive landing page (static).
- `css/styles.css` ‚Äî Clean stylesheet for the landing page.
- `docs/SAFE_USAGE.md` ‚Äî Guidance and legal/ethical usage.
- `modules/` ‚Äî Documentation-only placeholders describing module intent (no code).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`

## Goals of this package
1. Present a clean, modern UI/README for the project.
2. Provide documentation and contributor guidance.
3. Avoid distributing any potentially harmful or operational tooling.

---
## How to preview
Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser (double-click or `open` it from your file manager).
This is a static site ‚Äî no server required.

---
## If you want help building safe, defensive tooling
I can help build:
- Secure audit checklists
- Static documentation websites
- Safe simulation/demo modules that do not perform attacks (mocked outputs)
- Training labs with intentionally vulnerable *separate* sandboxed VMs, using safe instructions

**I cannot** provide working exploit code, C2 servers, automated payload builders, or instructions
that would enable unauthorized access.

Created with ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äî modernized README (safe demo).
